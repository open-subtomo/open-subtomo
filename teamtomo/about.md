# About Teamtomo

Teamtomo was created by [Gutsche Lab]() as part of a [publication](). We chose the name because the hashtag [#Teamtomo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/teamtomo) was already sometimes used by members of the Cryo-ET community to share info or ask questions on Twitter.

The current maintainers are [Alister Burt]() and [Lorenzo Gaifas](), but the platform is intended to develop as a community effort. We plan to de-centralize the maintenance soon, in order to allow easier contributions from other parties and a more open, transparent platform.

If you need help, want to suggest something or have some question about **Teamtomo**, don't hesitate to use the [issue tracker] on the repository, or to send and email to the mailing list at [ttomo@googlegroups.com](mailto:ttomo@googlegroups.com).
