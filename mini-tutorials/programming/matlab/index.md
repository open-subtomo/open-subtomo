# MATLAB

This area of the site is for general information on using `MATLAB`. 

This section exists because lots of early subtomogram averaging tools were originally written in `MATLAB`, including the [TOM Toolbox](https://www.biochem.mpg.de/6348566/tom_e). 

[Dynamo](https://wiki.dynamo.biozentrum.unibas.ch/w/index.php/Main_Page) is also `MATLAB` based and contains many useful tools.
