# `dtmslice` viewing controls

`dtmslice` is a 3D tomogram viewer with many powerful annotation tools - 
see the documentation [here](https://wiki.dynamo.biozentrum.unibas.ch/w/index.php/Dtmslice).

This document explains the basics of visualising a tomogram in `dtmslice`

## Slicing
`dtmslice` depicts a 2D slice of a 3D volume at its position within the 3D volume.

Important parameters of the slice are 
- the `position` of the slice
- the `thickness` of the slice
- the projection direction of the slice

These can be controlled from the `Shown slice` controls on the left hand side of `dtmslice`

A slice can be moved along it's projection direction by `left-click` + dragging the mouse
or using the mouse wheel.

A `thickness` of 10 means that the displayed slice will be an average over 10 slices 
along the projection direction.

The projection direction can easily be changed between 
'x', 'y' or 'z' by hitting the `x`, `y` or `z` keys with your mouse on the slice. 
Mouse position controls the new position of the slice.

You can move around the scene by `ctrl` + `left-click` + dragging the mouse.

You can save a copy of the active slice in `dtmslice` by hitting the `s` key.
