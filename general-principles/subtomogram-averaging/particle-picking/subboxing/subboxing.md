# Subboxing

Subboxing means deriving particle positions and orientations from an existing set of positions and orientations, usually centered on a region of interest.

This process is useful for
- simple recentering of particles
- focussing on individual subunits in a complex

A typical use case is shown in the image below, where subboxing has been used to generate the orange particles from the blue particles 
in the lattice structure of 
[*EMD-10160*](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/emdb/EMD-10160).
