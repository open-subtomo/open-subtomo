# Cryo-electron tomography

Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) is a 3D imaging modality with high spatial resolution and low signal to noise ratio.

A series of 2D transmission electron micrographs of a thin, vitrified specimen are recorded from different orientations are combined to produce a 3D reconstruction.

To correct for mechanical stage movement during imaging and beam-induced sample motion a tilt-series must be [aligned](tilt-series-alignment.md) before 3D reconstruction.
