[teamtomo.org](https://github.com/teamtomo/teamtomo.github.io) is a collaborative, 
online platform for sharing knowledge within the cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) [community](https://twitter.com/hashtag/teamtomo).

Cryo-ET is a 3D imaging modality which uses 
[transmission electron microscopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy) 
to image proteins, their assemblies and thin cellular sections in their native state with high spatial resolution.

Cryo-ET data is noisy and incompletely sampled. 
Subtomogram averaging procedures align and average noisy imaging data to produce 3D reconstructions of 
objects of interest. This increases in signal-to-noise ratio and interpretable resolution.

If you're new to cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging, check out our 
[overview](general-principles/overview) 
and data processing 
[guides](guides/index).
