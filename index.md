# Home
[teamtomo.org](https://github.com/teamtomo/teamtomo.github.io) is an *open* and *collaborative* platform for sharing knowledge in the cryo-electron tomography (Cryo-ET) [community](https://twitter.com/hashtag/teamtomo).

Cryo-ET is a 3D imaging modality which uses [transmission electron microscopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_electron_microscopy) to image proteins, their assemblies and thin cellular sections in their native state with high spatial resolution.

Cryo-ET data is noisy and incompletely sampled. Subtomogram averaging procedures align and average noisy imaging data to produce 3D reconstructions of objects of interest. This increases in signal-to-noise ratio and interpretable resolution.

If you're new to cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging, check out our [overviews](general-principles/overviews/overviews) and data processing [guides](guides/index).

Looking for something more specific? Check out our [mini-tutorials](mini-tutorials/mini-tutorials) and [general principles](general-principles/general-principles) sections!

If you wish to contribute or suggest some change, check out the [contributing](teamtomo/contributing/index) guidelines.

Still couldn't find what you were looking for? Ask the community by sending an email to the mailing list over at [ttomo@googlegroups.com](mailto:ttomo@googlegroups.com), or use the [#teamtomo hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/teamtomo) on Twitter.
