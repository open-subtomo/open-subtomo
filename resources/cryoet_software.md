# Cryo-ET software

## crYOLO

[crYOLO](https://sphire.mpg.de/wiki/doku.php?id=pipeline:window:cryolo) is a particle picker for electron microscopy data written by 
[Thorsten Wagner](https://twitter.com/pixelbaumarkt?lang=en).

The software was recently extended to include picking in tomograms. Documentation can be found [here](https://cryolo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Dynamo

`Dynamo` is a flexible, extensible software environment for subtomogram averaging written by [Daniel Castaño-Díez](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=emXRLtwAAAAJ&hl=en).

This area of the site is for mini-tutorials explaining how to do things in `Dynamo`.

## EMAN

EMAN is a single particle analysis software from the 
[Ludtke lab](https://www.bcm.edu/research/labs-and-centers/faculty-labs/steven-ludtke-lab).

It contains an integrated solution for cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging. 

The workflow and programs are described [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0591-8) 
and the source code is available [here](https://github.com/cryoem/eman2).

## emClarity

`emClarity` is an integrated cryo-ET solution. 
The publication describing it can be found 
[here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0167-z) 
and the 
[source code](https://github.com/bHimes/emClarity) 
is freely available.

The most comprehensive guide to using `emClarity` can be found 
[here](https://github.com/ffyr2w/emClarity-tutorial/blob/master/emClarity-tutorial.pdf).

## IMOD

[IMOD](https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/) is a set of image processing, visualisation and modelling tools which has been 
actively developed for more than 25 years at the University of Colorado.

The package was originally described [here](https://doi.org/10.1006/jsbi.1996.0013). 
The [tomography guide](https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/tomoguide.html) 
is an extremely complete resource for working with electron tomography data in IMOD.

## M

M is a software package for multi-particle refinement of cryo-EM data written by 
[Dimitry Tegunov](https://twitter.com/dtegunov?lang=en).

The software is described [here]([multi](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.05.136341)) 
and source code is available [here](https://github.com/cramerlab/warp).

## Nova
[Beata Turoňová](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZHvxBgcAAAAJ&hl=en) has written a set of programs for cryo-ET data analysis.

### NovaCTF
NovaCTF is a program for the reconstruction of tomograms which takes into account variations of the CTF in 3D (3D-CTF correction.)

The program is described [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1047847717301272) and source code is available [here](https://github.com/turonova/novactf)

### NovaSTA
NovaSTA is a C++ port of subtomogram averaging scripts from the 
[TOM/AV3 package](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0409178102). 

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/turonova/novaSTA).

## RELION

[RELION](https://www3.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/relion/index.php?title=Main_Page) is a program for maximum *a posteriori* (MAP) refinement of (multiple) 3D reconstructions
in cryo-electron microscopy actively developed in the [Scheres lab](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/groups/scheres/).

The original program is described [here](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2012.09.006) and source code is available [here](https://github.com/3dem/relion)

## STOPGAP

STOPGAP is a MATLAB-based package for subtomogram averaging written by [William Wan](https://www.wan-lab.org/).

The source code is available [here](https://github.com/williamnwan/STOPGAP).
