# IMOD

[IMOD](https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/) is a set of image processing, visualisation and modelling tools which has been 
actively developed for more than 25 years at the University of Colorado.

The package was originally described [here](https://doi.org/10.1006/jsbi.1996.0013). 
The [tomography guide](https://bio3d.colorado.edu/imod/doc/tomoguide.html) 
is an extremely complete resource for working with electron tomography data in IMOD.
