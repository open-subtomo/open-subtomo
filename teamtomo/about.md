# About

`teamtomo.org` was created by members of the 
[Gutsche Lab](https://www.ibs.fr/research/research-groups/microscopic-imaging-of-complex-assemblies-mica-group-i-gutsche/?lang=fr) in an effort to improve the ability of the cryo-ET community to integrate newcomers. [#Teamtomo](https://twitter.com/hashtag/teamtomo) is often used by members of the Cryo-ET community to share info or ask questions on Twitter.

The project is currently maintained by [Alister Burt](https://twitter.com/AlisterBurt) and [Lorenzo Gaifas](https://twitter.com/brisvag/), but the platform is intended to develop as a community effort. We plan to de-centralize the maintenance soon, facilitating contributions from other parties and a more open, transparent platform.
