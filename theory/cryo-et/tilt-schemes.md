# Tilt-schemes

Tilt-schemes define the order in which data are collected in cryo-ET experiments. The 'best' tilt-scheme depends on what the reconstructed tomograms will be used for.

Optimal results from subtomogram averaging experiments have been obtained using the [dose-symmetric](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsb.2016.06.007) tilt-scheme implemented by [Wim Hagen](https://twitter.com/wimjhh?lang=en). This scheme and others were benchmarked in [this](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-14535-2) publication.
